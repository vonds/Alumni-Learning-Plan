About Project
========================================
T
his is a small calculator project I built. I tried to keep it simple and used it as an opportunity to practice some OOP with JS. It went more or less well. I could have fixed the input field to not include letters but for now this will do.

How it was made:
============================================

JavaScript, Html, Css,


what I've learned
============================================
-I've learned that writing out your sudo code before anything else goes a long way.
-I used the eval method in this project but I read that it's dangerous and should be avoided. In the future I'm going to find alternatives.
-OOP maked for cleaner more organized code
